-----Git-----
		At first the new dirctory has been created in the ubuntu terminal. In that directory, few .doc, .txt, .pdf files will be created. The git init command will be performed to initiate the git dependencies i.e, .git files. Later on git add <directory name> will be performed to add the working directory which gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history. Then the git commit -m <message> will be performed which takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users. Here git status command will be used to know the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. You’ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what’s being included in the next snapshot.
