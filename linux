_____Linux Workflow_____
1) I have learned few linux commands and they are:
pwd - present workking directory : which displays the directory in which we are working.
ls - displays the list of all the files in the folder or directory.
ls -la - displays all the hiden files
ll - displays all the permissions like read, write, edit, etc..
clear - clears the screen
etc..

Working directory: the files which does not come under traking status, such are is known as the working directory.
